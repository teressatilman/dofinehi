                            <p> With all the chaos of the lineup being done with for the most part I finally wanted to take the opportunity to share this with you all. I spent a good while curating some tips for first time Okeechobeeings and even OGs. I'm so happy I got to go last year because now I learned from my camping experience what I should and shouldn't do/bring. I hope to be of some sort of help to future Okeechobeeings. Feel free to comment other tips/items you may have and I will edit them into it. I didn't 
With the 1-year anniversary of the arrival of my 2018 I7 Matebook X Pro fast approaching, I thought I’d write up a review of my experiences with this laptop in hopes that it may be helpful for people that are considering purchasing it (or potentially the 2019 version). Feel free to send me questions or recommendations. I started medical school this last summer and I was very interested in doing biomedical research, particularly in-silico (computer based) drug discovery using enzyme I bought an ElectriQ portable air con unit about a year ago for the bedroom and it was a life saver last summer. One issue with it, however, is that it turns on and off a lot, particularly when it isn't as hot. I believe this is because the temperature sensor is either positioned badly or is simply faulty. When it's turned off, I've checked the temperature it thinks the room is at and it will say below the cut-off temperature (e.g. 16 degrees) when the Nest I have in the room for controlling. Hello community, This is my first post. I am most recently a first time tripper who is most likely seeking validation for the experience. Good grief, this is a long one, I hope SOMEONE makes it through. CONTEXT I tripped on LSD for the first time ever a few days ago. I have experience with other substances: I chronically used cannabis for eleven years; I drank Ibogaine tea when I was 19, and felt like I died and was reborn; I used ecstasy a few times in my early to mid-twenties Hello guys, Please help me. The more tweaks I have the more battery it'll take I know And do I have tweaks that do the same thing as others installed (like 2 that do the same exact thing 😂, I know Dune and eclipse for example but Dune gives me dark dock and folders) (iPhone 6s+ btw if that helps) 7-zip (POSIX): 16.02-1 AlarmFade: 1.1.0 AppCake: 6.1.3 AppList: 1.5.15~beta1 AppSync Unified: 32.0 APT (apt-key): 1.4.9-1 APT 1.4 Strict (libapt-pkg): 1.4.9-1 APT Command Line: 1:0-2 APT Strict. 
I’ll start with some of my my favorites. I use all this while camping short of the ruck. Tactical Tailor RR5100/MALICE ruck - this bad boy with the sleep compartment is almost 7000 cubic square inches compared to 5000 to to the MOLLE with sustainment pouches. All the pouches for easy access and much, much more comfortable. Everyone has to dump their ruck to get one thing while the TT ruck you just open a pocket. Plus this ruck is jumpable to big Army SOP. Camping chair with back support. https://imgur.com/a/6o2OQbA In theory the thought of sitting in a theater for 59 hours straight sounds pretty crazy, doesn't it? Well it's definitely crazy, but if you're prepared it can be a blast! I went to the 31 hour marathon last year and can say that it was honestly the best two days of my life. Sitting in a theater with a hundred other hardcore fans was amazing, and I've never felt so close to a group of strangers. So how did I make it through with my sanity? I was actually pretty. Peeing will be hard and this device is a life saver. I gifted one to my friend 5 years ago when she complained about the logistical challenge of going to the bathroom. I was so lucky to have this info before I went in for the same procedure!

So I’ve used floating dock plus plenty of times no problem I stopped using for a while and recently decided to re install in and every time I do it installs fine then resprings as normal but then if I try to go to any app the app will open to a complete black screen and I can’t do anything so I have to turn phone of re jailbreak with tweaks of and remove it then re jailbreak with tweaks on is there a tweak or something that is causing this ?? I’m on iPhone X 11.2.2 using unc0ver 3.0.1 Tweak. I've been looking for a good gaming laptop for around 00 CAD, and I am willing to go up to around 00 CAD. I need a laptop that has an i7-8750H, anything better than a GTX 1060 (No Max-Q), 16 GB dual channel RAM, 144 Hz 1080p IPS 17.3 inch screen (Preferably 3ms response time with minimal bezels), has decent to good battery life (Around 5 hours with low brightness, battery saver and Optimus enabled), and 1 TB of storage (I don't care too much about SSD's) and has a small footprint/thin. Like its larger sized 17-inch counterpart,Lenovo's 15-inch Legion Y740 is really an helpful GeForce RTX-based gaming laptop by having an attractive high-end element established.The look is plainer than most,nevertheless the bodily construct is good and,compared with the 17-inch edition,completely portable for a gaming machine.The Legion Y740 is just not pretty a discount at this rate,as well as the battery existence is disappointing,nonetheless it represents fair value to the factors and feature. Here’s my tweak list, hopefully someone can tell me which one it is. I’ve tried disabling most home screen tweaks and the issue still persists. 7-zip (POSIX): 16.02-1 A Whole Lot Of Zeppelin 2: 1.2 A Whole Lot Of Zeppelin: 2.0 Activator: 1.9.13~beta4 adv-cmds: 119-1 AnimationsBeFast: 1.4.5 Aporeo: 2.3 App Admin: 1.0r-101 AppList: 1.5.14 Apps Manager: 1.5.0-12 AppSync Unified: 32.0 APT Strict (lib): 1:0 APT Strict: 1:0 Assuan: 2.5.1-1 Asteroid: 2.0.1 AudioSnapshotServer: 1.0.0 Aweza: 1.0 Bano:. 
Wow, it feels good! Some questions were really tricky. You gotta think of the best option by eliminating the others. Few questions, you need to read them twice and understand the phrasing. My learning: gt 3 weeks of self-study (~6 hours a day) with minimal networking experience at school. gt Guide by Todd Lammle (although, I'm pretty sure some questions had commands not covered in the book) gt CCNA Routing and Switching Portable Command Guide by Scott Empson (This one's a life saver!. What are your favorite memories? I remember ordering mine on launch day, and getting it about 2 weeks later. I remember how tough it was to get one during launch. I had just broken up with my ex back then, so getting it was definitely a nice distraction. I had saved up some money aside in preparation for it and got a screen protector with the leftover money. It really had a nice iPad effect, where I remember many of my classmates asking me about it. It even got a couple of guys interested. 🎓🎓 College students know a computer is not just a tool to keep up with email or surf through social media. College life is demanding and academic reliance on computer technology is only growing. Having a fast computer is not a luxury anymore, it is a necessity. For all the things that phones and tablets can do, the need for a computer is still a must.Students know their computer is where the bulk of coursework is created and completed and where tons of research happens. There is no clear replac. Many times throughout the day Cydia freezes on my iPhone X (using the latest unc0ver beta)  My phone then restarts and i have to rejailbreak. I have completely removed the jailbreak three times already but it didn’t help. I was wondering if any of the below tweaks could be the problem. Unfortunately CrashReporter isn’t showing the issue.

There’s a weird alarm related bug which causes the jailbreak to panic and freeze.
