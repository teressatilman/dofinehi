                            <p>The way we approach card balance in Clash Royale is a combination of playtesting, listening to the community and looking at the stats. You can expect monthly balance updates to keep gameplay fine tuned and as fun as possible. In this balance update we're taking a look at Freeze, Three Musketeers, Cannon Cart and more! Watch the quick-look video (https://youtu.be/w6FG9I0STcw)​​! \--- Musketeer: Damage +3% The basic Musketeer Troop is supposed to be a strong single target ranged attack. # MAME 0.209 (https://www.mamedev.org/?p=468) With another month over, it’s time for another release, and MAME 0.209 is sure to have something to interest everyone. We’ve cracked the encryption on the Fun World CPU blocks, making Fun World Quiz, Joker Card, Mega Card, Power Card, Multi Win, Saloon and Nevada playable. Regular contributor shattered has added Кузьмич-Егорыч (Kuzmich-Egorych), a Russian Mario Brothers bootleg running on heavily modified Apple II hardware. In other Apple I want to fully analyze the talking point that "Bitcoin is a store of value," because it's one that I see very frequently and people have different views on how the value of an asset is generated. This one is also fun because I get to put on my Economist hat instead of my Computer Engineering hat which has always been a strong secondary interest of mine. Please buckle in, because this is a longer read, but if you have any doubts about how value is generated, I really think it's a worthwhile.

Hello all! This was my first time using Carvana to purchase a car, so this post is a little wordy. I wanted to try and address any questions a potential buyer may have. I certainly had quite a few but am pleased with how my experience with Carvana worked out. Just for a little background on me, in the past I have absolutely been a hard deal haggler from the dealer, or wherever I can find the best price on the best car possible. I live in Charleston, SC and when buying my last car, I found. # MAME 0.208 (https://www.mamedev.org/?p=467) Today we’re proud to bring you MAME 0.208. There are some big improvements to SunPlus SPG240/SPG280 audio emulation. Not only does this greatly improve the enjoyability of the JAKKS Pacific TV games, it’s also timed perfectly for the addition of the Fisher-Price I Can Play Piano music teaching system. That’s not the only newly supported music system this month: we’ve added Jumping Popira, and Popira 2 has been promoted to working. Continuing. Cross-posting this question (https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/bgxx6m/poweredge_2900_no_boot_working_raid_help_me/) that I asked /r/techsupport but got nada - really hope escalating to /r/sysadmin can give me an ideas of where to go next. I've inherited a Poweredge 2900 that refuses to boot ("Strike F1 to retry boot, F2 for setup utility"). On it is a physical Win2K3server with a highly specialized vendor-installed database and front end. The backups turned out to be database. 
Update Edit: - Thanks for the replies! I've had a chance to read all your posts. Yeah, I've kinda resigned myself to know that this car will not be super peppy. Looking at all the other stickshift AWD options, the Focus RS and the Golf R, I'll be driving the car more as a pragmatic utility vehicle that can be a bit sporty, rather than a sport hatch back in which I will occasionally use it for utility. That being said, the Golf R alllllllmost fits the bill.

Hi all! I'm in the process of shopping around to get financing on a vehicle, and something has come up and I am now a loss as to how to proceed. The lender wants a copy of any document that can verify my residential address in order to also be able to verify my identity. Issue is - I have nothing to provide. - My driver's license is years old and has an old address listed. I can't update my license with new address for the reason below. - I don't currently own a home, but I'm not particularl. They're all a little different, yet close enough to compare. Here's why: New, some of these cars are much higher than others. The Giulia Ti Sport stickers for 46k, whereas the GS F stickers for k. How can we compare? For one, the GS F is one of the worst depreciating cars in over a decade. A 10,000-mile GS F can be had for under k. Lexus reliability is still there, but this is an absolute monster that's like new, and stacks up against other cars mentioned here. For anyone looking to spend. I have a few clarifications and an update on my MIL Gozer. This is a long one. For a full background on Gozer, you can go through my post history as this account is solely for this purpose but for those who don't want to or don't have the time to dig through the mountain of crap she has pulled over the last few years I will give some more important points. Gozer loves guilt trips and playing the victim. She often changes the timeline of events to fit her narrative and thinks that her feelings.

Hello everyone. Since Elementary os is usually one of the first stops when switching from a different os I've decided to write this list of distro-independant tweaks (well, the first 2 are for elementary only). I hope you may find some useful. The last 3 may require some patience to pull off if you're new to tweaking. amp#x200B; NOTE: I'll use io.elementary.code because this is elementary's text editor. On regular ubuntu (gnome) you'd have to use gedit, on xubuntu (xfce) mousepad, on lubuntu. 1. If I turn off the PC and turn it on, the device will flash open a couple of times during BIOS loading/windows loading, but in total, once I am booted, the device is turned off. ( I have to plug it in and out to make it start.) I 've read on this issue, tried disabling my HD AUDIO from my BIOS MOBO, tried disabling Fast Boots etc. Did the same for Windows. Also went to device manager to disable power saving after sleeping. Nothing fixxed my issue. 2. on the GSP 600, after a certain point I saw an older thread here. https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8zb0gd/guide\_mdt\_wds\_setup\_for\_os\_deployment/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8zb0gd/guide_mdt_wds_setup_for_os_deployment/) I know it's many many months later, but I thought I would chime in, because it seems to be a hot topic to talk about. Here's what I know. You can deploy Windows Desktop/Server 1 of 2 ways. through static imaging (takes up a lot of space since it has to be expanded, takes.
